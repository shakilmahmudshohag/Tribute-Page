      <b>Manjiro Attributes:<b/>
        <ul>
          <li>Mikey is usually a carefree teenager who loves to joke and play pranks around those he considers his close friends.</li>
          <li>He cares for them greatly and is determined to protect their honor. </li>
          <li>He rarely shows any sign of weakness, as he believes himself to be the foundation and support for Toman, and if the pillar himself were to display weakness, Toman would also be weakened. </li>
